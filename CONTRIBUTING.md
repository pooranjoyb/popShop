## Avoid Conflicts {Syncing your fork}

An easy way to avoid conflicts is to add an 'upstream' for your git repo, as other PR's may be merged while you're working on your branch/fork.

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/pooranjoyb/popShop
```

You can verify that the new remote has been added by typing

```bash
git remote -v
```

To pull any new changes from your parent repository simply run

```bash
git merge upstream/master
```

This will give you any eventual conflicts and allow you to easily solve them in your repo. It's a good idea to use it frequently in between your own commits to make sure that your repo is up to date with its parent.
